<p>My name is Elisabeth, I’m a 24 years old computer science student living in Montreal. <br><br>I’m an ex-politician with a degree in international studies and foreign languages. <br><br>I had a quarter of life crisis and decided to take the plunge in STEM and go back to school. I’m a bit late to the party but I’m thrilled to be here. <br><br>I’m a queer space enthusiast with a passion for open source code and 19th century technology.

    <h1>About this project</h1>
  <p>

I’m going back to school in September!<br><br> I’ll be studying computer science in Cegep du Vieux-Montreal!<br><br> I have a background in humanities and since my coding experience is relatively new, I decided to do the #100daysofcode to be a little more prepared.

<br><br>

This project allows me to create a website and recreate a few famous games! Tic-Tac-Toe, Tetris, Rock-Paper-Scissor, Pong! And Pac-Man. I might even add a few more later in the project. <br><br>I have worked with HTML5 and CSS3 in the past, but this is my first attempt at JavaScript.
